              At Michigan’s Best Golf Deals, we offer great golf deals 24/7, 365
              days a year. Each participating course has committed to a great
              discount for golfers of all categories, as well as, additional
              discounts and information that they can change at their
              discretion, to keep you informed of additional discounts, upcoming
              events, and course and facility information. How does it work?
              When you open the site, you’ll see that there is a tab to select
              the courses page. When you select that page, you’ll see a list of
              courses that you can sort by several filters including distance
              from you, location by county, type of course, and facility and
              amenities information.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="mt-4">
            <p>
              Once you’ve selected any filters that you want to include in your
              search, just select a course from the list and you’ll be directed
              to that course’s page with their particular discounts and offers,
              as well as a link to their page. To use any of that course’s
              discounts you have to be a member.{" "}
              <b className="bold">
                In most cases, just one use of our discounts will more than
                cover the cost of your subscription.
              </b>{" "}
              To see the value of a particular course’s offers, just contact
              that course via phone or the link to their site and calculate the
              savings based on their standard rates.{" "}
              <b>
                You can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars in just one
                season.
              </b>{" "}
              Each course must sign an agreement that one of their offers will
              be permanent for an entire season. This allows you to know up
              front the minimum savings you will get with each use at that
              course. The number of uses available for this particular discount
              is up to each course and will be posted on the discount coupon.
              These offers will include BOGO’s, foursome discounts etc
